CSCI 5525 Project - UMN Spring 2022
Group members: Kyler Sood, Nirmal Raj, Wangyang Ge, Abha Gejji

To run Jupyter notebooks with the dataset, you need to first download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to the Colab server.
Our notebooks are made to run using Colab but should also run in Conda Jupyter.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

Included in our submission: 
CSCI 5525 Final Project.pdf - a five-page writeup of our final project, a survey of various
machine learning methods applied to a water potability dataset found on Kaggle.

Water Potability Classic.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and implementations
of several ML methods for the data set. We evaluate SMOTE, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and
several other models in this notebook.

Water Potability DL.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and an implementation of
three neural networks and an ensemble neural network along with evaluation. Trained on a GPU.

Water Potability DT Adaboost.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and an implementation
of decision trees and decision trees using the AdaBoost algorithm to attempt to improve performance. 

Water Potability KNN.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and an implementation of
the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm on the dataset without using SMOTE.
